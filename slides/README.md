## How to contact me / ask a question?

**Technical questions**: e.g. help on a compiler error, need precision on a
part of the assignment, a general question about the curriculum → Ask on
~~Discord~~ Teams (and tag me)

group, etc ... → Send a mail at <yvan@sraka.xyz>

## Grades

### CC

Every class is a small-group workshop.

**Every workshop is graded.**

Workshops & readings are split into a _mandatory_ VS _bonus_ parts.

Grading is **automated** through Travis CI.

### Exam

I will ask you to record a 2-5 min video presenting your final project, in a
lightning talk format.

The last class slot is for feedback about the curriculum / your submission.
