# [Readings] Ownership & Borrowing

## Mandatory

Watch [into_rust()](http://intorust.com/) video about "Ownership" by Nicolas Matasakis.

I give you here handy tools that will help you with homework and graded project (e.g. to improve super mastermind):

- [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
- [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)

## Bonus

Supplementary links to feed your curiosity:

- There is no null pointers in Rust! Why? Watch "[Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/)" from Tony Hoare
- Some more readings for the brave: "[What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)" by Ulrich Drepper from Red Hat

Next class we will debug C and Rust programs, fighting the borrow checker!
